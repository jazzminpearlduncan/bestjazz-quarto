This shoot was an amateur attempt at an improvised *Cowboy-Themed World Series Poker Match*. With each player designing their own character, we assumed our chosen roles as we played Hold 'Em for *9 hours* to get the appropriate shots, queues, and to finish the game, most importantly.

I played my OC, *Psychic Cowboy*, who had a pet bear (that they could telepathically communicate with) and who also happened to come into an $80 fortune at the end of the game after a blisteringly tense 3-hour-long stand-off between *Psychic Cowboy* and another player.
