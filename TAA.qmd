This is a Community-Based Application project for Data, Justice Past and Future - a class at Pitzer College. Me and 3 other group members conducted research on the labor practices, investments, data ethics, and work environment of Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Apple - 4 of the most popular employers for STEM students at the 5C's. 

The archive has since been abandoned as a project; but it is meant to serve as encouragement for students to be conscientious about their decisions post-graduation.
