We can see that cows are substantially more centered in the dairy industry, while other milks, like water buffalo, go relatively unnoticed. You can also see countries in multiple different groups demonstrating both the breadth and nicheness of their cheeses, Italy being particularly noticible in this regard.\nTidyTusedy dataset: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/a95bcce0d7e09590519ba1ff98512fbf10f443af/data/2024/2024-06-04\nData origins: cheese.com, a blog and resource for cheese lovers, collected this data."

    "text": "This is an ongoing project, planned to be completed in early March, focusing on a specific clip from a Betty Boop cartoon featuring a rotoscoped animation of a ghost dancing. The original footage, traced over to create the animation, was a performance of “Minnie the Moocher” by Cab Calloway and his Cotton Club Band—an influential group that played a role in laying the conceptual groundwork for MoTown and Black Hollywood’s rise to prominence throughout the 20th century. While the animated version has become an iconic artifact, even evolving into a meme, it has overshadowed its source material, simultaneously preserving and erasing history. This project will explore how animation can both immortalize and obscure cultural contributions, examining the interplay between adaptation and historical visibility. The final product will be a few-minute-long animated short that traces key moments in animation history, incorporating stylistic recreations, narration, and archival references."

    "text": "“Halloweekend in Claremont: A Documentarian Analysis of 5C Party Promo Culture” is a documentary that was produced as a group project for my Anthropology of Digital Cultures class. Beginning development in October 2024, 2 of my classmates – Mira Settycharity and Simran Saini – and I conducted ethnographic research centering cresting racial, administrative, and political tensions both internal and external to Pomona College, and their effects on how on-campus parties are promoted, and, more importantly, how the promoters and attendees interact (or don’t) with one another.\n\n  \n    \n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\n  \n\n\nThis short documentary gives a brief, intimate peek into the parties thrown throughout Halloweekend 2024 (Oct 31 - Nov 2). Examining music, design, communication pipelines, and administrative changes at Pomona since the 90’s, we designed this prject to include the documentary below and a complementary ethnographic research paper.\nI edited this in it’s entirety, and filmed about a third of the content; the aesthetics are intentionally unpolished, shaky, and unclear to emulate the chaos and instability reflected both in a night out and emerging political tensions in Claremont. The low quality, however, is for file processing reasons to display on this site."
