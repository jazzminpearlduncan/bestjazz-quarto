    "text": "This is an ongoing project, planned to be completed in early March, focusing on a specific clip from a Betty Boop cartoon featuring a rotoscoped animation of a ghost dancing. The original footage, traced over to create the animation, was a performance of “Minnie the Moocher” by Cab Calloway and his Cotton Club Band—an influential group that played a role in laying the conceptual groundwork for MoTown and Black Hollywood’s rise to prominence throughout the 20th century.\nWhile the animated version has become an iconic artifact, even evolving into a meme, it has overshadowed its source material, simultaneously preserving and erasing history. This project will explore how animation can both immortalize and obscure cultural contributions, examining the interplay between adaptation and historical visibility. The final product will be a few-minute-long animated short that traces key moments in animation and music history, incorporating stylistic recreations, backtracking, and archival references."

    "text": "The Loop is a product of the collective work of students across the 5 Claremont Colleges. Created by Circuits, Internet, Media, and Software, The Loop has published one issue, and the second is currently in progress! Submit here! We don’t discriminate! As the Founder, I am incredibly proud of the momentum, content, and community this magazine has fostered in such a short amount of time, allowing me and my peers to grow as both artists, organizers, and multimedia fanatics.\nI independently curated and edited each submission, designed each page, and led print distribution with stringent time constraints. This magazine was primarily meant to be humanitarian, platforming and dignifying student works that would otherwise be forever stuck in their files; however, it has developed into a more mature, formalized production as the organization behind it, CIMS – founded by me as well–, has grown due to my persistent scouting of new E-Board members, student works, and potential events.\nThis experience has prepared me to report on, organize, and advise people and ideas, especially those related to media, technology, and culture. Having to collaborate extensively across a wide variety of academic disciplines has allowed me to gain the necessary experience to begin learning the ropes of doing so professionally, whether as a journalist or representative.\n\n    It appears you don't have a PDF plugin for this browser.\n    No biggie... you can click here to\n    download the PDF file."

    "text": "“Halloweekend in Claremont: A Documentarian Analysis of 5C Party Promo Culture” is a documentary that was produced as a group project for my Anthropology of Digital Cultures class. Beginning development in October 2024, 2 of my classmates and I conducted ethnographic research centering the cresting racial, administrative, and political tensions, both internal and external to Pomona College, and their effects on how on-campus parties are promoted, and, more importantly, how the promoters and attendees interact (or don’t) with one another.\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    \n  \n\nThis short documentary gives a brief, intimate peek into the parties thrown throughout Halloweekend 2024 (Oct 31 - Nov 2). Examining music, design, communication pipelines, and administrative changes at Pomona since the 90’s, we designed this project to include the documentary below and a complementary ethnographic research paper.\nI edited this in it’s entirety, and filmed about a third of the content; the aesthetics are intentionally unpolished, shaky, and unclear to emulate the chaos and instability reflected both in a night out and emerging political tensions in Claremont. The low quality, however, is for file processing reasons to display on this site (apologies for the 480p!)."
