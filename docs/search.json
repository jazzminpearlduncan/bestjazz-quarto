    "text": "^^^listen to Icon - Jaden Smith to hear this sampled!\nThis is an ongoing project, planned to be completed in early March, focusing on a specific clip from a Betty Boop cartoon featuring a rotoscoped animation of a ghost dancing. The original footage, traced over to create the animation, was a performance of “Minnie the Moocher” by Cab Calloway and his Cotton Club Band—an influential group that played a role in laying the conceptual groundwork for MoTown and Black Hollywood’s rise to prominence throughout the 20th century.\nWhile the animated version has become an iconic artifact, even evolving into a meme, it has overshadowed its source material, simultaneously preserving and erasing history. This project will explore how animation can both immortalize and obscure cultural contributions, examining the interplay between adaptation and historical visibility. The final product will be a few-minute-long animated short that traces key moments in animation and music history, incorporating stylistic recreations, backtracking, and archival references.\nThe short will feature clipped performances from Cab Calloway, the Nicholas Brothers, Janet Jackson, and other, more contemporary musicians; as well as references to key moments in culture, specifically from the perspective of a young adult who was raised on music videos (me)."

It contains about 32, 000 rows – each a different song – and 26 columns (track_id, track_name, track_artist, track_popularity, track_album_id, track_album_name, track_album_release_date, playlist_name, playlist_id, playlist_genre, playlist_subgenre, danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, and duration_ms). About 5000 songs were collected from each of 6 major genres – R&B, Rock, Rap, Latin, Pop, and EDM.\nPLOT 1\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# str_detect and 1 reg. exp.\nmy_set &lt;- spotify_songs |&gt; \n  filter(str_detect(playlist_genre, \"r.\"), !is.na(track_artist)) |&gt;\n  select(track_artist, playlist_genre) |&gt;\n  group_by(track_artist, playlist_genre) |&gt;\n  summarise(popularity = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(playlist_genre, desc(popularity)) \n\ntop_10_artists &lt;- my_set |&gt;\n  group_by(playlist_genre) |&gt;\n  slice_max(order_by = popularity, n = 10)\n\n# plot 1\nggplot(top_10_artists, aes(x = reorder(track_artist, popularity), y = popularity, fill = playlist_genre)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Artist Names\",\n    y = \"Occurences in Dataset\",\n    title = \"Top 30 Most Mentioned Artists in Rock, Rap, and R&B\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6, angle = 45))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot displays the top 10 most mentioned artists from each of the Rap, Rock, and R&B genres, including a count of how many mentions and colors to indicate genre. I’ve chosen these genres because they are my personal most played genres (specifically when DJing), and I was curious as to how one of my sets may compare to the tastes demonstrated through the data artist-wise. The name that doesn’t appear on the plot is ‘オメガトライブ’, which I’m not sure how to make visible.\nWe can see that Queen and Guns n Roses are the most recurrent, Queen being an outlier with 134 entries. It would appear that Rock is the most popular genre of the 3, with Rap being the least popular. It’s also interesting to see Drake’s bar, as he is the only artist with multiple genres listed (33 R&B, 36 Rap), which isn’t surprising considering the sheer amount of mingling with genres he does.\nPLOT 2\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n# lookaround, str_detect, and 2 reg exp\n\ngirl_songs &lt;- spotify_songs |&gt; \n  select(track_name, playlist_genre) |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(track_name, \"(?&lt;=girl)(?! boy)\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(gender = \"Girl Mentions\") |&gt;\n  group_by(playlist_genre, gender) |&gt;\n  count(name = \"girl_count\")\n\nboy_songs &lt;- spotify_songs|&gt;\n  select(track_name, playlist_genre) |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(track_name, \"(?&lt;=boy)(?! girl)\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(gender = \"Boy\")|&gt;\n  group_by(playlist_genre, gender) |&gt;\n  count(name = \"boy_count\")\n\n# rearranging data\ngendered_songs &lt;- left_join(girl_songs, boy_songs, by = \"playlist_genre\") |&gt;\n  select(playlist_genre, girl_count, boy_count) \n\ngendered_songs_long &lt;- gendered_songs |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(girl_count, boy_count),\n               names_to = \"gender\", values_to = \"count\") |&gt;\n  mutate(gender = recode(gender, girl_count = \"'Girl' Mentions\", boy_count = \"'Boy' Mentions\"))\n\n# plot 2\nggplot(gendered_songs_long, aes(x = playlist_genre, y = count, fill = gender)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Genre\",\n    y = \"Count of Mentions by Gender\",\n    fill = \"Gender\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot displays the difference between mentions of the words ‘girl’ and ‘boy’ in their titles by genre, with the counts for either gender and colors to idicate genderas well. I chose to do this pplot because I was curious about how and where either sex was mentioned; however, without a context variable (sounds very messy), it doesn’t provide much insight into the genres.\nWe can see that rap music has the most mentions of the word “boy”, and R&B has the most mentions of the word “girl”. Generally, other than in R&B, the word “boy” tends to be mentioned more often in titles than “girl”.\nAdditional Work\n\n#str_subset\n\njazz_songs &lt;- str_subset(spotify_songs$track_name, \"Jazz|jazz\")\njazz_albums &lt;- str_subset(spotify_songs$track_album_name, \"Jazz|jazz\")\n\nI wanted to see how many songs or albums may be related to Jazz, 1) because I am named after it, and 2) because I was surprise that it wasn’t even a genre subcategory. There are 9 songs that mention ‘jazz’, case insensitive. There were 22 albums with Jazz in the title.\n\n#str_extract\n\nspelled_jazz_songs &lt;- str_extract(spotify_songs$track_album_name, \"(?i)(?=.*[j])(?=.*[a])(?=.*[z]).*\")\nspelled_jazz_songs_filtered &lt;- spelled_jazz_songs[!is.na(spelled_jazz_songs)]\n\nHere, I was wondering if I could spell out my name by extracting the letters from song titles; there are 106 songs where this would be possible, if I were doing the phenetic spelling. The second Z is not included in many of these, so I technically couldnt spell my name with all of these titles, but I would be able to soound it out."

    "text": "about me\nMy name is Jazzmin, or Jazz, and I am currently a Junior at Pomona College studying Media Studies and Data Science, with a concentration in Electronic Media. I’ve bounced around several different interest areas – including (but not limited to) AI, Intellectual Property Law, DJing, and News Writing – and have found that Data Science and Media Studies perfectly capture my undying interest in the transfer of information.\nData transfers, radio signals, news casts, remixed tracks; it’s all information that’s been diced up to appeal to or be understood by different subjects. This concept, that everything we process (including media) is just re-purposed data, is not new; however, it has underpinned my extracurricular and professional pursuits.\nI love to experiment with boundary-stressing avenues of both data and cultural expressions, particularly through writing, music, and video editing. Chopping and screwing visual, sonic, numerical, textual, and historical data, I aim to broach the world of entertainment journalists; bridging my creative ability to tell complex stories with my passion for the dissemination of information through high-impact, culturally relevant work.\n\n\nabout my work\nI have been writing as a journalist for 6 years; producing audio-visual content (documentary film, fan-edits, music, etc.) for 3 years; and managing several coinciding cross-disciplinary projects for 2 years. From The Knight Times Newspaper to The Post Newspaper of Galveston County to The Feedbacker, I’ve maintained a pointed interest in pop-culture developments and entertainment news, varying between print and visual media as mediums for storytelling through my reporting. Starting Circuits, Internet, Media, + Software (CIMS), my on-campus production organization, has been my boldest step in embracing this vision of a multi-media, interdisciplinary work environment.\nPublishing The Loop – a Zine collection dedicated to dignifying and platforming student artwork, writing, software, and interactive media projects – under CIMS, as well as maintaining scheduled community engagement and education events, is one of my proudest achievements, skill- and concept-wise; one that I am looking forward to expanding upon professionally.\nEmbracing music, film, and writing as chosen mediums, I am looking to pursue a career in entertainment journalism, music A&R, or creative content development where I can continue to hold my hand to the pulse of pop-culture, challenge arbitrary boundaries, advocate for underrepresented voices, platform important conversations, and investigate how people and information interact with one another.\n\n\nabout my interests (hyperfixations)\nIn my free time, I play The Sims (either 2 or 3); my total time played now totals ~4700 hours! If I’m not doing that, I’m probably mastering audio for a DJ set, writing poetry, or simply doing classwork.\nIf you’re curious, my top 4 movies (on Letterboxd) are as follows: The Wiz (1978), Zola, Blackkklansman, and A.I. Artificial Intelligence. (Honorable Mentions: The Princess and The Frog, Tales from the Hood, Django Unchained)\nCurrent hyperfixation blurb: I am currently experimenting with music production and animation tools; and I am absolutley enamored by the process of mastering audio, then building a given storyline off of the music, documenting what and how I see and feel when listening to music. I’m deeply fascinated by the process of generating narrative value through sound, which is embedded with a wealth of cultural knowledge.\nI also am entranced by timelines in media; how cultural artifacts progress, change, and build upon themselves over time, especially music, performance, and film."

As the Founder, I am incredibly proud of the momentum, content, and community this magazine has fostered in such a short amount of time, allowing me and my peers to grow as both artists, organizers, and multimedia fanatics.\nI independently curated and edited each submission, designed each page, and led print distribution with stringent time constraints. This magazine was primarily meant to be humanitarian, platforming and dignifying student works that would otherwise be forever stuck in their files; however, it has developed into a more mature, formalized production as the organization behind it - CIMS, founded by me as well – has grown due to my persistent scouting of new E-Board members, student works, and potential events.\nThis experience has prepared me to report on, organize, and advise people and ideas, especially those related to media, technology, and culture.

Examining music, design, communication pipelines, and administrative changes at Pomona since the 90’s, we designed this project to include the documentary below and a complementary ethnographic research paper.\n\n  \n    \n      \n      Your browser does not support the video tag.\n    \n  \n\nI edited this in it’s entirety using iMovie, designed our interview questions, and filmed about a third of the content; the aesthetics are intentionally unfocused, shaky, and unclear to emulate the chaos and instability reflected both in a night out and emerging political tensions in Claremont at the time. The low quality, however, is for file processing reasons to display on this site (apologies for the 480p!)."

Each of them were written for classwork, and are research papers generally centering around themes of race, politics, and digital worlds.\nPrejudicial Posthumanism: A Racialized Reframing of Artificial Life Narratives\nThis essay explores the intersection of posthumanism, AI, and societal biases, particularly in Western culture. It argues that narratives surrounding artificial life, from ancient myths to modern science fiction, reflect and perpetuate deeply ingrained prejudices. As AI develops, these biases may be amplified, shaping how we understand and interact with AI technologies. The essay critically examines how films like Blade Runner and Ex Machina mirror fears of subjugation, servitude, and racial oppression, projecting these anxieties onto AI. It emphasizes the need to reconsider AI narratives to avoid replicating historical injustices, calling for a future where AI promotes ethical coexistence and mutual growth.\nWritten in: Spring 2024\nFor: Cinema and AI - Pomona College\n^Also published in The Loop\n Crafting Virtual Worlds: The Art, Impact, and Implications of Video Game Modding\nThis essay explores video game modding as an example of Socially-Engaged Software – software meant to respond to the desires of communities rather than individuals. Defined by mutual aid and recursive digital support, modding communities have both stood at odds and peacefully coexisted with video game production companies. In this essay, I explore this illusive relationship, as well as the act of modding itself as online political resistance, self-expression, and an affirmation of digital liberty.\nWritten in: Spring 2024\nFor: Socially-Engaged Software - Scripps College\n The Internet: A Reframing of the Bridge Between the Real and the Fake\nThis essay explores how social media bridges digital and physical activism, countering claims that it fosters only passive engagement. It examines the role of weak and strong ties in activism, the free-rider problem in movements, and how decentralized digital organizing mobilizes resources and drives collective action. It also highlights how online activism legitimizes movements and mirrors historical grassroots efforts. Ultimately, the essay reframes social media as a powerful tool for political organizing with real-world impact.\nWritten in: Fall 2023\nFor: Political Dialogue and Resistance - Pomona College"
