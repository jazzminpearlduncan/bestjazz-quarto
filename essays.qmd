[Prejudicial Posthumanism: A Racialized Reframing of Artificial Life Narratives](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fT7zhOf9CH2nU6f8SnbkJ9_DfPmWZemg/view?usp=drive_link){target="_blank"}

This essay explores the predominate themes of Sci-Fi films with narratives involving AI. Connecting religion, race, and film theory, I argue for close consideration of attitudes and actions surrounding AI, warning of potential disaster driven by overzealous fear or hope.

[Crafting Virtual Worlds: The Art, Impact, and Implications of Video Game Modding](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1igrVCOuhWqQR1OfucNFupQ5tIMp2iTLI/view?usp=drive_link){target="_blank"}

This essay explores video game modding as an example of *Socially-Engaged Software* -- software meant to respond to the desires of communities rather than individuals. Defined by mutual aid and recursive digital support, modding communities have both stood at odds and peacefully coexisted with video game production companies. In this essay, I explore this illusive relationship, as well as the act of modding itself as online political resistance, self-expression, and an affirmation of digital liberty.

[The Internet: A Reframing of the Bridge Between the Real and the Fake](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_iD7_O4GCbyMWFvxQa818CSkZ9ekhAhP/view?usp=drive_link){target="_blank"}

This essay explores how social media bridges digital and physical activism, countering claims that it fosters only passive engagement. It examines the role of weak and strong ties in activism, the free-rider problem in movements, and how decentralized digital organizing mobilizes resources and drives collective action. It also highlights how online activism legitimizes movements and mirrors historical grassroots efforts. Ultimately, the essay reframes social media as a powerful tool for political organizing with real-world impact.
