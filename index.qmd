This is my homepage where I showcase various projects and ideas.

Hello! And thank you for visiting!

I coded this entire site using R and GitHub Pages! 

Note (2/27/25): If you're reading this right now, the page is unfinished, and actively being filled as you read! Check back in a couple of hours to see the finished product! If you want to read something in the meantime, see my resum√© or the first issue of The Loop (both found in the navigation bar above; The Loop is under projects).
