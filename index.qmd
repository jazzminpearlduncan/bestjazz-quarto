Hello! And thank you for visiting!

I coded this entire site using R and GitHub Pages! 

Note (2/26/25): If you're reading this right now, the page is unfinished, and actively being filled as you read! Check back in a couple of hours to see the finished product! If you want to read something in the meantime, see my resumé or the first issue of The Loop (both found in the navigation bar above; The Loop is under projects).
